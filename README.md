# SocpedStorageDemo

What is Shared Storage ?
Every app has there own private Directory in Internal Storage
i.e android/data/your package name not visible to other apps
Everything else is shared Storage is. Media Collection  and other folder
App ask permission to have access to storage for simple functions like User to pick profile pic and download image etc. all this are left behind when the app is uninstalled. And user suffer from low disk space

Redesigned Storage - 
Scoped Storage - 
Divide the collection into specified Collections and limit the acsess the to whole storage 
Better Attribution
Which  app created which file 
Useful when App is uninstalled ,all the data related to app is also uninstalled 
Protecting App Data
Internal app directories and external app directories are been private
Protect user data
Download image not to use bye other app

Principles:

Unrestricted access to your own app storage(Internal / External)
Not Permission Required
Unrestricted Access  to Media files and Download Collection
Save image file Without Permission
Only Media  Collection can be read with Storage Permission
 Location metaData ACESS_MEDIA_LOCATION for location of image 
For Pdf , Etc  file Use System Picker 
Reading and Writing outside of collection requires the system Picker

-RequestLegacyAcess tag -  In manifest file we can still add to use the permission access like in lower version than Android 10.But only used by 2% of android app, and also  gonna soon deprecated in next version of android

  Upon getting a document uri returned, we can use
  [ContentResolver.takePersistableUriPermission] in order to persist the
   permission across restarts.
   This may not be necessary for your app. If it is not requested, access
    to the uri would persist until the device is restarted.
